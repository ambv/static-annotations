============================================

This GitHub repo is used for drafting of this PEP.  Technical discussion
around the PEP should happen in the issue tracker.  The official PEPS
repository is only updated when a new draft is posted on python-dev.
The python.org site automatically updates (with a slight delay,
typically in the order of 5-60 minutes) whenever the python/peps repo is
updated.
